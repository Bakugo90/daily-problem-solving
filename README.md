# Daily Problem Solving

[![Problems Solved](https://img.shields.io/badge/problems%20solved-1-brightgreen)]() [![Languages](https://img.shields.io/badge/languages-Python%20%7C%20JavaScript-blue)]()

A personal initiative to level up my problem-solving skills by documenting and implementing solutions to problems from HackerRank and LeetCode. This repository serves as proof of work and a journal of my learning journey.

## Objective

To consistently solve algorithmic problems, document my thought process, and maintain a portfolio of well-explained solutions that can be referenced in the future.

## Repository Structure

Each root-level folder represents a problem category from HackerRank and LeetCode:

```
daily-problem-solving/
├── implementation/     # Implementation problems
├── sorting/           # Sorting algorithms
├── string/            # String manipulation problems
└── README.md
```

### Problem Folder Structure

Each solved problem follows this structure:

```
problem-name/
├── PROBLEM.md         # Problem statement and constraints
├── SOLUTION.md        # Thought process and explanation
├── python/            # Python implementation
│   ├── solution.py
│   └── test.py
└── javascript/        # JavaScript implementation (when applicable)
    ├── solution.js
    └── test.js
```

## Problem Categories

### [Implementation](./implementation/)

Problems focused on implementing specific algorithms or logic.

- [Flatland Space Stations](./implementation/Flatland%20Space%20Stations/) - Finding maximum distance to nearest space station

### [Sorting](./sorting/)

Problems involving sorting algorithms and techniques.

*Coming soon...*

### [String](./string/)

Problems focused on string manipulation and algorithms.

*Coming soon...*

## Documentation Format

Each problem contains:

1. **PROBLEM.md**: Detailed problem description, examples, constraints, and link to original problem
2. **SOLUTION.md**: My thought process, algorithm explanation, complexity analysis, and implementation notes
3. **Source code**: Clean, commented implementations with test cases

## How to Use This Repository

1. Browse problems by category
2. Read the `PROBLEM.md` to understand the problem
3. Review the `SOLUTION.md` to see my approach and thought process
4. Check the implementation in your preferred language
5. Run the tests to verify the solution
